    "# End-to-End Time Domain Audio with fastai\n",
    "\n",
    "`fastaudio` focuses on spectrograms. `fastai`\n",
    " use cases tend to focus on classification. We need to go beyond those. Instead we'll focus on two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. autoregressive prediction in the time domain. We'll use an LSTM -- essentially adapting the language model lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  audio-to-audio processing/translation (e.g. audio effects). We'll use stacked 1D convolutions like a U-Net\n",
    "\n",
    "(you probably noticed already that task #1 could be in task #2, for the case of translating to audio shifted ahead by one sample.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"How many channels of audio are we going to use?\"\n",
    " That's up to the dataset!  We're certainly not going to assume that it's just mono.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"What other fastai datatypes/projects are relevant?\"\n",
    " There are three packages that are relevant for sequence modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `fastaudio`, as we mentioned, is only for spectrogram classification. The `AudioBlock` makes batches using an entire audio file which then gets converted to spectrograms.  Instead, we want to progressively grab sequences of audio samples and as (uniform-length) chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The [Time Series Prediction](https://timeseriesai.github.io/tsai/) package is relevant, but the only time series output it seems to support is [\"univariate forecasting\"](https://timeseriesai.github.io/tsai/#Univariate-Forecasting).  Nope. \n",
    "3. Language Modeling, e.g. Chapters [10](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/10_nlp.ipynb) and [12](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/12_nlp_dive.ipynb) from fastbook. Yea, that's the closest. We can treat the audio samples as if they were word vectors/embeddings: just make the tokenizer and numericalize methods to be no-ops (or we could use mu-law encoding).  Nice thing is the dimensionality of the embeddings is just equal to how many channels of audio you have. \n",
    "   \n",
    "We'll use *some* of fastaudio but we'll also liberally rewrite/overwrite whatever we want. We'll start with their imports..  "
