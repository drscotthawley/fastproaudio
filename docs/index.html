<h2 id="Idea-behind-this-repo">Idea behind this repo<a class="anchor-link" href="#Idea-behind-this-repo"> </a></h2><p><code>fastaudio</code> focuses on spectrograms. <code>fastai</code> use cases tend to focus on classification. We need to go beyond those. Instead we'll focus on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>autoregressive prediction in the time domain. We'll use an LSTM -- essentially adapting the language model lessons</p>
</li>
<li><p>audio-to-audio processing/translation (e.g. audio effects). We'll use stacked 1D convolutions like a U-Net</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(you probably noticed already that task #1 could be in task #2, for the case of translating to audio shifted ahead by one sample.)</p>
<h4 id="&quot;How-many-channels-of-audio-are-we-going-to-use?&quot;">"How many channels of audio are we going to use?"<a class="anchor-link" href="#&quot;How-many-channels-of-audio-are-we-going-to-use?&quot;"> </a></h4><p>That's up to the dataset!  We'll try our best to assume that it's just mono.</p>
<h4 id="&quot;What-other-fastai-datatypes/projects-are-relevant?&quot;">"What other fastai datatypes/projects are relevant?"<a class="anchor-link" href="#&quot;What-other-fastai-datatypes/projects-are-relevant?&quot;"> </a></h4><p>There are three packages that are relevant for sequence modeling:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>fastaudio</code>, as we mentioned, is only for spectrogram classification. The <code>AudioBlock</code> makes batches using an entire audio file which then gets converted to spectrograms.  Instead, we want to progressively grab sequences of audio samples and as (uniform-length) chunks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://timeseriesai.github.io/tsai/">Time Series Prediction</a> package is relevant, but the only time series output it seems to support is <a href="https://timeseriesai.github.io/tsai/#Univariate-Forecasting">"univariate forecasting"</a>.  Nope.</p>
</li>
<li>Language Modeling, e.g. Chapters <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/10_nlp.ipynb">10</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/12_nlp_dive.ipynb">12</a> from fastbook. Yea, that's the closest. We can treat the audio samples as if they were word vectors/embeddings: just make the tokenizer and numericalize methods to be no-ops (or we could use mu-law encoding).  Nice thing is the dimensionality of the embeddings is just equal to how many channels of audio you have. </li>
</ol>
<p>We'll use <em>some</em> of fastaudio but we'll also liberally rewrite/overwrite whatever we want.</p>
<p>...And this may not be useful to more than a few core people. We'll see. ;-)</p>
